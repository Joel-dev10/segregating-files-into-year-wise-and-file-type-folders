Problem Statement:
Each folder contains a number of files, and there are n total. All of the files must be organised into folders based on the year that they were last edited, and within these folders, the files must be arranged according to their type. The complete procedure should take place while employing multiprocessing and moving the files from an input location to an output location.

Future Scope:
The solution can be further used for data cleaning. For example, a person who has shot thousands of pictures and videos can use the solution to segregate all the files, and with the help of computer vision and machine learning can create a template for storing the photos and videos while removing the duplicates and the files with low quality content (blurred).
